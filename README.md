## üèóÔ∏è Setup & Deployment

### 1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nasa-clean.git
cd nasa-clean
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in `backend/`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...yourkey...
NASA_API_KEY=DEMO_KEY
```

**Never commit `.env` files to git!**

### 3. Install dependencies

```sh
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### 4. Run locally

Start backend:
```sh
cd backend
npm start
```

Start frontend:
```sh
cd ../frontend
npm start
```

The frontend will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and connect to the backend at `REACT_APP_API_URL` (set in `.env` or via proxy).

### 5. Deploy

- **Render.com:** Add both `backend` and `frontend` as separate web services. Set environment variables in the dashboard.
- **Vercel/Netlify:** Deploy `frontend` as a static site, `backend` as a serverless function or Node service.
- **Heroku:** Deploy both as separate apps or use a monorepo buildpack.
